# Fallon Pulido's portfolio

## Project Description

Welcome to my web portfolio, this is the portfolio that I have created as part of the web dev ii course in which we have learned about advanced CSS and bootstrap. The design of this portfolio is based on what we learned in the UX course where we learned about the audience we want to address, we did a certain study of clients and evaluated the correct way to approach them according to what will be offered as a service.

## Challenges

What I found most difficult to apply was the size of the images and how to use them correctly on different screen sizes. I think that's what I'm still having a hard time fixing.

## Lessons Learned

I basically learned from scratch how to work with a design and build in html/css using the bootstrap framework and customizing it.
